# BodyMassIndexCalculator-MVVM

BodyMassIndexCalculator is an app which you can learn your body status according to your weight and height.Users can enter their height and weight values by using sliders.When they clicked calculate button.They can see a result alertController which says thie index and some advices.I have tried to use MVVM design pattern in this app.I gathered all logic and business codes in ViewModelBMI file.Calculating process and show alertController process are boh in this file and when i want to use them, it's easy to just call them in View part as a class variable.Thanks to MVVM, i created a nice app with less code.
